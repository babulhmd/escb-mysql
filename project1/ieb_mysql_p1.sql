(5, 'Harun Rashid', 'Since Harun was intellectually, politically, and militarily resourceful, his life and his court have been the subject of many tales, some factual, but most believed to be fictitious. One factual tale is the story of the clock that was among various presents that Harun sent to Charlemagne. The presents were carried by the returning Frankish mission that came to offer Harun friendship in 799. Charlemagne and his retinue deemed the clock to be a conjuration for the sounds it emanated and the tricks it displayed every time an hour ticked.[3] Among what is known to be fictional is The Book of One Thousand and One Nights, which contains many stories that are fantasized by Harun''s magnificent court and even Harun al-Rashid himself.[4]\r\n');
